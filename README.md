# Javascript API Client Code for plantuml diagram generating

I have implemented this solution for my needs, because code from their site does not work for me

1) Install some deflate capable npm library

2) Get input data like: @startuml Bob -> Alice : hello @enduml
  
4) Use compress function to generate compressed URL for API call to plant UML server from input
